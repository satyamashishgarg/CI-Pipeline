# CI-Pipeline
A CI pipeline is a crucial component of DevOps that helps automate the process of integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. The pipeline ensures that the code is built, tested, and validated before it is merged into the main branch.

This pipeline retrieves the code from a Git repository, builds a Docker image, runs tests, and finally pushes the image to a Docker registry for deployment. You can configure this pipeline to trigger automatically whenever new code changes are pushed to the repository.
